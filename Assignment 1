Use Case: Fraud Detection in Banking
1. Data
Data Sources:
Transaction Data: Logs of customer transactions including time, amount, merchant details, and location.
Customer Data: Information such as age, account type, past transaction history, and spending patterns.
Device & IP Data: Device fingerprints, IP addresses, and geolocation to detect anomalies.
External Fraud Reports: Data from regulatory agencies or fraud databases to recognize known fraud patterns.
Data Issues:
Imbalanced Data: Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate transactions, making it challenging for models to learn effectively.
Noisy Data: Incorrect or incomplete entries in the database can affect model accuracy.
Concept Drift: Fraud tactics evolve over time, so models trained on past data may become ineffective.
Privacy Concerns: Customer financial data must be handled securely, complying with regulations like GDPR or PCI-DSS.
Types of Data:
Structured Data: Transaction logs, user demographics, and categorical data like account type.
Unstructured Data: Customer complaint texts, chat logs with support, and behavioral data.
Time-Series Data: Sequences of transactions over time to identify anomalies.
2. Problem Statement
Banks and financial institutions face increasing fraudulent activities such as unauthorized transactions, identity theft, and account takeovers.
The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent transactions in real-time while minimizing false positives.
The solution should adapt to evolving fraud tactics, ensuring minimal disruption to genuine customers.
